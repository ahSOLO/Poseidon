<h3>Template Creation Guide</h3>
<br>
<h5>Choosing a word processor</h5>
<p>Poseidon's templates are created using any word processing program that can save files in the .DOCX format. Among others, these include: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> Microsoft Word, </li>
    <li> Google Docs, </li>
    <li> Apache OpenOffice, and </li> 
    <li> LibreOffice Writer.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Drafting the template</h5>
<ol>
    <li><b>Identify the Variables:</b> It is useful to start with a copy of the type of document you wish to automate. Take note of all the information inside the document that needs to be modified each time it is drafted. 
    These are the <i>variables</i>.</li><br>
    <li><b>Tag the Variables:</b> Replace each of the variables inside your document with the following tag: {{ variable_name }}, where "variable_name" is replaced by a unique name to be given to that variable. 
    For example, "Gunther lives in Canada" can be replaced with "{{ first_name }} lives in {{ country }}". Variable names should not contain spaces or special symbols, with the exception of underscores. 
    Please also leave a space between the variable name and the curly brackets. </li><br>
    <li><b>Upload the Template:</b> Once the variables have been tagged, remove any remaining text that you do not with to reproduce on the final document. 
    If you wish to include special rules or dynamic lists to your template, consult the "Advanced Tags" section below. Otherwise, the template is ready to be uploaded to Poseidon--an upload form is provided at the bottom of this page.
</ol>

<h5>Advanced Tags</h5>
<p> Poseidon's tagging system also allows for more advanced use cases. Here are some examples:
<ul>
    <li><b> Conditional Variables:</b> When drafting the template, you may create <i>conditional variables</i>. 
    Conditional variables allow you to make certain additions to your document <em>if</em> a certain variable is marked as true. For example, consider the following snippet: <br><br>
    <h6> {% if condition %} The condition is true {% endif %}. </h6> <br>
    Here, a conditional variable called "condition" was created. The type of value that can be assigned to a variable is determined when creating the form. A conditional variable can only take on the value of "True" or "False".
    If this variable is marked as "True" when the form is being populated, the phrase "The condition is true" will be added to the final document. </li><br>
    <li><b>Lists:</b> Poseidon also allows for the creation of dynamic lists. When drafting the template, you may use the following language to create a list: <br><br>
    <h6> {% set myList = [list_1, list_2, list_3, list_4, list_5] %} {% for item in myList %} {% if item %}<br>
    1.	{{ item }} {% endif %} {% endfor %} </h6><br>
    This will create a list of up to five entries long. Note that "1.  " represents the beginning of a list that is recognized by the word processing program. 
    list_1 through to list_5 are variables that should be included in the form. Once set up, this will give the person populating the form the ability to enter up to 5 entries on the list, 
    and the final document will dynamically adjust the size of the list based on the number of entries that have been filled out on the form. 
</ul>
<p> Poseidon's tagging system is built on the open source library python-docx-template. For more information about the syntax used, please consult <a href="https://docxtpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">the following resource</a>.
